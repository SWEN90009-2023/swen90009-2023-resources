# Sprint 4 Assessment Checklist
This checklist helps you double check your work for Sprint 4.


## Acceptance Criteria
Make sure your Acceptance Criteria satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete: The acceptance criteria completely cover all the capabilities required by the client. 
- [ ] Consistency: The acceptance criteria are consistent with the client's expected behaviour of the problem and with user stories. 
- [ ] Narrative: The acceptance criteria present a narrative consistent with capabilities relevant for the client. 
- [ ] Presentation: The acceptance criteria document is clearly laid out. The tests contain no typos or spelling errors.


## Acceptance Tests
Make sure your Acceptance Tests satisfy the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete: The acceptance tests completely cover all the capabilities required by the client. 
- [ ] Consistency: The acceptance tests are consistent with the client's expected behaviour of the problem and with other artefacts. 
- [ ] Realistic: The acceptance test use realistic data as inputs and outputs. 
- [ ] Narrative: The acceptance tests present a narrative consistent with capabilities relevant for the client. 
- [ ] Presentation: The acceptance criteria document is clearly laid out. The tests contain no typos or spelling errors.


## Mood board
Make sure your Mood board satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete report/document showing how complete, consistent and realistic is the mood board. 
- [ ] Explain why you decided to use a colour palette, UI elements and references.


## High Fidelity Prototype
Make sure your High Fidelity Prototype satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete: The high fidelity digital prototype completely illustrates the capabilities required by the client. 
- [ ] Consistency: The high fidelity digital prototype is consistent with the client's expected behaviour of the problem and with other artefacts. 
- [ ] Realistic: The high fidelity digital prototype will contain realistic data as pre-stored data, and as inputs and outputs in its screens (if required). 
- [ ] Narrative: The high fidelity digital prototype will present capabilities following a narrative relevant for the client. The narrative will be available along with the prototype (as a set of written instructions, for instance). 
- [ ] Presentation: The high fidelity digital prototype will be built without interaction or flow errors. Limited interaction paths consistent with the narrative are acceptable. Clicking an unexpected button with the result of an inconsistent state or inconsistent data is not acceptable. The available interactions and narrative clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the expected system. High-fidelity interactions and look and feel is expected. When possible, client corporate colours and logos should be used (in consultation with the client). The prototype will contain no typos or spelling errors and text will be clear and unambiguous. The source file of the high fidelity digital prototype will be available in Confluence along with a link to the prototype. 
- [ ] Software: The high fidelity digital prototype will be created using Axure or Figma.



## Data Sample (tests)
Make sure your Data Sample satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete: The data sample is complete for the most important user stories. 
- [ ] Consistency: The data sample is consistent with the digital prototype UI 
- [ ] Realistic: The data sample is realistic.


## Traceability Matrix
Make sure your Traceability Matrix satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete: All the user stories and acceptance tests are listed in the matrix.


## Usability Test (Validation Tasks and VIDEO)
Make sure your Usability Test Video satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 4 scenarios/tasks were created and validated with the client (high fidelity prototype). 
- [ ] Tasks are related to main user stories (high priority). 
- [ ] Tasks are available/updated in Confluence. 
- [ ] Prototypes were not presented but tested. 
- [ ] The video is between 2 and 4 minutes (this video MUST be presented and discussed in your final presentation).
- [ ] The video file will be available in Confluence (not only as a link).


## Usability Test (FEEDBACK/NOTES)

- [ ] Team has documented received feedback from usability test and put together an action plan to address comments/issues. These notes MUST be presented and discussed in your final presentation.



## GitHub
Make sure that: 

- [ ] Folders are structured (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 4: Moodboards, digital prototype, acceptance criteria, acceptance tests, data sample and traceability matrix" page: you can find requirements for folders' structure.)
- [ ] Sprint 4 documents were exported from Confluence and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 4: Moodboards, digital prototype, acceptance criteria, acceptance tests, data sample and traceability matrix" page: you can find requirements for the baseline tag)
