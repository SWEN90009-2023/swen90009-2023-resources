# Sprint 2 Assessment Checklist
This checklist helps you double check your work for Sprint 2. 


## do/be/feel list
Make sure that your do/be/feel list satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Granularity: The list has an adequate level of granularity that helps understand and explain the context of the project. 
- [ ] Complete: The do/be/feel list completely covers the information elicited during the session and other interactions with the client. DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy are well presented. 
- [ ] Consistency: The do/be/feel is consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with other artefacts. 
    

## Goal Model
Make sure that your Goal Model satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Granularity: The goal model has an adequate level of granularity that helps understand and explain the context of the project and its motivation. It shows well the goals of the system to be develop to a level of detail similar to user stories. The level of granularity allows for a correct association of quality and emotional goals to particular functional goals.
- [ ] Hierarchy: structure The hierarchy of functional goals makes perfectly sense for somebody not familiar with the problem domain and it can be followed to explain and motivate the problem to an external party. Use of elements The notation has been followed and the elements have been used correctly.
- [ ] Complete: The goal model completely covers the information elicited during the session and other interactions with the client. DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy are presented together with the model.
- [ ] Consistency: The goal model is consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy.
- [ ] Presentation: The goal model has an elegant and neat layout, including clarity (labels and spelling).



## Personas
Make sure that your personas satisfy the following criteria:

- [ ] Realistic:The personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with industry partners. 
- [ ] Range:The personas represent a sufficiently wide range of behaviours of target users for the system. There is evidence that a variety of types of personas have been considered (*diversity is extremely important*). 
- [ ] Distinct:The personas present distinct behaviours and do not overlap (unless justified by the students). 
- [ ] Usefulness:The personas present a rich description of the users and give a good understanding of the person's motivation and behaviour. 
- [ ] Presentation:The presentation of the personas is elegant and attractive, they are well written, clear, without ambiguities or typos. 
- [ ] Process: There is evidence that the process to create personas has been followed and it has been well documented.


## Consistency between Goal Model and Personas
Make sure that your Goal Model and Personas satisfy the following consistency principles (CP):
  - [ ] CP1: There should be at least one persona for every role in the motivational model.
  - [ ] CP2: Every persona should relate to a role in the motivational model.



## GitHub
Make sure that: 

- [ ] Folders are structured (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 2: Do/be/feel, goal model and personas" page: you can find requirements for folders' structure.)
- [ ] Sprint 2 documents were exported from Confluence and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 2: Do/be/feel, goal model and personas" page: you can find requirements for the baseline tag)
