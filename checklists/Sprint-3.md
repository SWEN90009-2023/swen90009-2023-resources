# Sprint 3 Assessment Checklist
This checklist helps you double check your work for Sprint 3.


## User Stories
Make sure that your user stories satsify the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete:The user stories completely cover the capabilities required by the client. 
- [ ] Consistency:The user stories are consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with other artefacts. 
- [ ] Justification:The user stories include justification ("so that") IF appropriate. 
- [ ] Priorities:User stories are well prioritized. The priorities can be traced back to the client and the choice of prioritization mechanism has been justified by the students. 
- [ ] Presentation: The user stories document is clearly laid out. The user stories are well-written and they are unambiguous. They contain no typos or spelling errors.


## User Story Map
Make sure that your user story map satsifies the following criteria:

- [ ] A user story map is provided/updated on Confluence (SWEN90014 students should be able to understand and edit that easily next semester). 
- [ ] The user story map prioritased and estimated requirements in a clear way.


## Low Fidelity Prototype
Make sure that your low fidelity prototype satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete:The low fidelity prototype completely illustrates the capabilities of at least four user story/task scenarios, aligned with client expectations. 
- [ ] Consistency:The low fidelity prototype is consistent with the client's expected behaviour of the problem and with other artefacts.
- [ ] Realistic:The low fidelity prototype will show realistic data as inputs and outputs in its screens. 
- [ ] Presentation:The prototype will be well built to clearly demonstrate the capabilities and interactions to the client with the task scenarios. The screens will contain no typos or spelling errors. 
- [ ] Task scenario (optional for low fidelity prototypes, however strongly encouraged as students can receive feedback and improve their task scenarios for high fidelity prototypes):The tasks are clear, well written, organized and consistent to user stories. They help the students validating the usability and the goals of the system. They are available on Confluence. **IF you submit this item, we will provide you feedback but won't give/deduct points in your sprint for this criteria.**



## GitHub
Make sure that: 

- [ ] Folders are structured (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 3: User stories, user story map, paper prototype and tasks validation video (usability test)" page: you can find requirements for folders' structure.)
- [ ] Sprint 3 documents were exported from Confluence and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 3: User stories, user story map, paper prototype and tasks validation video (usability test)" page: you can find requirements for the baseline tag)
