# Week 3 Workshop - Trello, Confluence and Github

In this workshop, you will start organising your project.  

## Discussion (team work - everyone must participate)
1.  Why is Trello, GitHub and Confluence important in the context of
    this subject? How can you benefit from the use of these tools? It's
    really important to discuss about the use of these tools in your
    project. Make sure everyone understands how you'll use these in the
    coming weeks/months \[5-10 minutes discussion\]

## Work on Your Project

### Trello
1.  create a board on <https://trello.com/> (one member will create the
    board and add members to it -- whoever creates the board will be the
    admin user). Naming: \<SWEN90009_2023_TWODIGITCODE_Animal\>; (e.g.:
    SWEN90009_2023_AA_Koala)
2.  add team members to your Trello board;
3.  add your supervisor to your Trello board;
4.  together with your teammates, discuss what columns you'll have in
    your Trello

Example:
![](.//media/image1.png)

5.  discuss what template you can adopt to describe the tasks involved
    in your project (all the cards should be similar in regard to
    details/description of the task)

My suggestion:

\[TEMPLATE FOR SPRINT TASKS\]

\[TITLE\] Task description in one or two sentences

\[LABELS\] what\'s the complexity of the task? (if longer than 5 days to
get it done, please break it into smaller tasks) SMALL (green colour): 1
day or less, MEDIUM (yellow colour): 2-3 days, LARGE (orange colour):
4-5 days

\[MEMBERS\] Who\'s involved in that task?\
\[DESCRIPTION\] additional details about the involved task.

6.  Once you agree on a template, keep your template ALWAYS visible on
    the top of your Trello column, as shown below

![](.//media/image2.png)

Example of card created with this template:

![](.//media/image3.png)

You can see the yellow label on top (medium complexity), the title of
the task/card, the name of the two students working on this task on the
bottom right side of the card (MP and SV) and, on the bottom left side
an icon showing there are more details inside the card. The green icon
also shows this card has 5 checklists on it. The details inside this
card are shown in the next image:

![](.//media/image4.png)

7.  use your Trello board during your weekly stand up meetings with your
    supervisor to discuss your progress in the project;


## GitHub
1.  create a PRIVATE repository on SWEN90009 GitHub organizations. You
    can access our Github organization here:
    <https://github.com/SWEN90009-2023>. Wait until you are invited/have
    access to it. **Do not create a repository outside our
    organization.**
2.  Repository naming: \<SWEN90009_2023_TWODIGITCODE_Animal\>; (e.g.:
    SWEN90009_2023_AA_Koala)
3.  add team members to your private project repository;
4.  structure your folders as detailed below:

>├── docs/		Documentation files (you can create subfolders here to organize your requirements)

>├── tests/		Validation and Verification tests; Data samples.

>├── prototypes/low fidelity/		low fidelity files (screens, mockups and so on)

>├── prototypes/high fidelity/		high fidelity files (screens, source files and so on)

>├── ui/		All the images created for the prototypes (icons, fonts, backgrounds\... should be here. This is different from the prototypes\' folders.  These are the graphical elements that goes into the prototypes)

>└── README.md

More details about the use of GitHub will be provided in the coming
days. For now, make sure you create this structure in your repository
(please stick to it). 

Keep this document professional. Make sure you list who attended the
meeting, when that happened, what was discussed and so on. Your
supervisor can help you with that.

Record meeting minutes after your workshops, team meetings, client
meetings and supervision meetings. Take turns. Different students can
document that in different weeks.

## Confluence

As part of this activity, let's discuss possible ways of organizing your
Confluence space (main pages, subpages, labels, keyworks and so on):

1.  Briefly discuss about your whole project scope, deliverables and so
    on. E.g.: requirements, goal model, personas, user stories,
    prototypes, meetings, and so on. Use our LMS Assignment page as a
    reference for our deliverables.

2.  Create a cover page for your project on your Confluence Space

-   Include the name of your project;

-   Create a table with additional details about your team:
    Photo\|Name\|Email\|

-   Please add the name of your client and contact details

-   Please add the name of your supervisor and contact details

    a.  Create a page named Specification on your Confluence Space

    b.  Create a subpage named Project Overview on your Confluence Space

3. Document your meetings 
- team meetings, supervision meetings and meetings with industry partners *must* be documented on Confluence (and only). As this is an internal information, it shouldn't be listed in Github. Confluence has templates to help you documenting your meetings. Make sure you use them.

> Describe the project background (motivation), problem and the scope of
> the solution. Its purpose is to be the initial brief for semester 2
> students (SWEN90014). The background should always reflect the latest
> shared understanding with the client (*keep it updated*). Keep it
> clear. Review your English and your texts. This is a VERY important
> task.
