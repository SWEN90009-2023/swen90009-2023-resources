# Week 4 Workshop - Do/Be/Feel list

In this workshop, you will practice building do/be/feel lists for your project.  

## Discussion (team work - everyone must participate)
1. In one paragraph (or sentence), what is the main goal of your project?
2. Who will use the system you are designing?
3. How the system will benefit your stakeholders?
4. When and how stakeholders will use the system you are designing?

## Work on Your Project - Create do, be, feel, who lists for your project

Before you start, just a quick recap that:
- Do: What should the software do? (Functional goals)
- Be: How should it be done? (Quality goals)
- Feel: Emotional (or social) considerations (Emotional goals)
- Who: Users involved (Roles)

In this workshop, you are asked to:
1. Identify the stakeholders of your project
2. Create do/be/feel (tm) lists for your project (based on client meetings/goals of your project).  Recall from lectures, your do/be/feel list should look like:

| Who  | Do | Be  | Feel | Concerns (optional) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     |

3. Migrate your list to Motivational Modelling tool (link to the tool will be provided to you later).  There is a [tutorial](https://cis-projects.github.io/project_based_course_notes/appendices/appendix_b/motivational_model_guide.html#) on how to do this in the course notes.
