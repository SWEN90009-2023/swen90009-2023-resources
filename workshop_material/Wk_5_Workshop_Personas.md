# Week 5 Workshop - Personas

## Discussion (team work - everyone must participate)

1.  What are personas? Why are they useful for requirement elaboration?
2.	How are personas constructed?

## Work on Your Project

Tasks to be performed:

1.	Review the steps for constructing personas

2.	Agree on what tool you’ll use to create personas for your project (everyone should use the same tool – consistency is key)

3.	Decide and assign different personas to different team members (so you can work in parallel and online)

4.	Create personas for your project. Remember that personas must have goals and illustrate different behaviour patterns. Personas must also be consistent to your WHO list (same stakeholders). 

5.	Once you finish creating a persona for your project, upload your example to Confluence. Each team member should provide at least one feedback to each other persona uploaded to Confluence. Feedback must be provided on Confluence page as comments. Once feedback is provided, rework your personas and update them on Confluence.
