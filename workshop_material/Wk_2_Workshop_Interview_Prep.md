# Week 2 Workshop - Requirements Elicitation 

## Discussion (team work - everyone must participate)

1.  Discuss what is involved in your project (system-as-is and system-to-be) this semester. 

2.  Identify a list of potential stakeholders for your project (and validate them during your meeting later one).

3.  Get organised to discuss your project with your industry partner:

    a.  discuss the roles each of you will take during the meeting: who's facilitating the meeting? who's taking notes? even though you have a facilitator, everyone is welcome to participate in the meeting

    b.  send a calendar invite to your industry partner with a Zoom link (make sure you organize that in advance). Details on how to communicate with your industry partner can be found here: https://cis-projects.github.io/project_based_course_notes/chapter_2/client_communications.html

    c. prepare an agenda for your meeting (small/flexible one. validate this with your supervisor before sharing it with your industry partner)

4.  Prepare a few questions (and/or other resources) for the meeting

    a. after your meeting with your industry partner, you should have a much better idea about what are your project challenges, goals and scope. what's the current way your industry partner has been doing things? how your software solution can help them improving their current process? who are your stakeholders? who's going to use this system and how?

    b.  can you also anticipate scenarios you could discuss with your client? document them. scenarios/examples are very important to identify existing processes in place.

I strongly recommend you explore the material below before interviewing your client:

**In this workshop, make sure you:**
-   review your interview guidelines (what to do before, during and after the interview? assign tasks to different people within your team. work together as a team.)
-   spend time preparing for the interview
-   document your elicitation technique on Confluence

After the meeting/interview
-   review your meeting minutes
-   share the meeting minutes with your industry partner
-   document the meeting minutes on Confluence
-   discuss about what did go well in your meeting
-   what didn't work in the meeting (how can you improve next time?)
-   what the observers thought about the interactions?
-   what was the general understanding about your project? (what is your project about? who is involved in your project? how the stakeholders will use your system? when they will use the system? can you put together scenarios on how each stakeholder will use the system you are designing?)
-   document everything on Confluence


Work collaboratively updating Confluence and GitHub. Some of you may focus on the Project Overview (Confluence) details, some may focus on the Requirements Elicitation page (Confluence). The remaining members can work on updating and generating the Sprint1 release tag on GitHub. Use this time to work together, as a team, in your project.
