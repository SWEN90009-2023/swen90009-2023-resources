In this workshop, you will practice writing acceptance criteria and acceptance tests.

## Discussion
1. Why we write acceptance criteria?
2. What are acceptance criteria used for?
3. What are acceptance tests used for? 

## Work on Your Project

### Acceptance Criteria

<p align="center">
<b>“Given [condition], When [something happens], Then [result]” </b>
</p>


Tasks to be performed:
1. Consider the user stories you created to your project (for now, focus on the ones with higher priorities);
2. Choose one user story for you to write acceptance criteria to (each student pick one user story);
3. Write one acceptance criteria for your chosen user story during this workshop (following the template you learned in the lecture);
4. Each team member should write a different acceptance criteria for a different user story;
5. Share your acceptance criteria with your team (if you are on an online tutorial, you can use the Zoom chat);
6. Review a different acceptance criteria from a different team member. Each student should review a different acceptance criteria;
7. Provide feedback to the reviewed acceptance criteria;
8. Review/rework your own acceptance criteria after receiving feedback from another team member;



### Acceptance Test

Tasks to be performed:
1. Each student work on the acceptance criteria that you have finalised in the previous activity. Write one acceptance test for it;
2. Share your acceptance test with your team;
3. Review a different acceptance test from a different team member. Each student should review a different acceptance test;
4. Provide feedback to the reviewed acceptance test;
5. Review/rework your own acceptance test after receiving feedback from another team member;



### Finally, remember to:
1. Upload the final improved version of your acceptance criteria to Confluence (shared page on Confluence to document all the acceptance criteria); Do the same for your acceptance test. 
2. Organize a table (in your Confluence Space) with the codes that you provided for the user stories and acceptance criteria and link them.  Do the same with your acceptance criteria and acceptance tests and link them.
